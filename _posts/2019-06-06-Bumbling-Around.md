So github is still new to me. Getting things vaguely situated. 
I went through the github hello world tutorial. 
It certainly helped clarify some of the lingo. 
I'm soon to start dataquest's data analysis with R path over. 
I went through the first few lessons without taking notes and I regret it. 
The guides I unlocked weren't enough. 
I'm on the last week of the coursera class Data Science Math Skills which I really enjoyed. 
It moves through topics quickly but covers the content well plus the resouce sheets are great. 
After I finish that, I'm going to begin a course covering Statistics with R to work concurrently with the dataquest path. 
Hoping both options together give me a good introduciton to R and some basic stats/maths.
