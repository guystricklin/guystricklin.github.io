Twelve big days since I last posted to this online diary. Sorry for the delay. Well I guess I'm saying sorry to myself. 

Either way, I'm making a little progress, a little bit at a time. 

Quick rundown of what I've been working on:
1. I'm still almost finished with the coursera course Data Science Math Skills course. I'm in the middle of the last week. Planning to knock that one out today.
2. I'm on the second week of Intoduction to Probability and Data. Good assignments in R.
3. I'm runing through the first couse in the Data Analyst in R Path on [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) I really like this program. Digging the missions, the branding, and the methodology.

Outside of those courses I'm been trying to orient myself a little better. I signed up for [The Memo](https://thememo.substack.com/) Its a newletter that shares remote-job postings related to tech. It's been a nice resource to see some aggregated postings.
