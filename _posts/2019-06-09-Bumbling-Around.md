I've been rolling some ideas around in my head concerning some basic projects for this stretch of learning.
I've come up with a few concepts.
I'll pitch the basics here and keep you updated on the progress.

1: What type of book sells best through Lemuria's website?
I'm sure I can get the data from our store reports.
It will probably need to be cleaned/tagged/organized and inerpreted.

2: I want to preform some type of basic visual analysis on a set of prints. 
Probably from Druer or Hokusai, both are widely available and documented.
Something along the lines of searching for relationships between points of contrast or color. 
I hope to be able to build my own small set of data through some type of graphic analysis then organize the results.

3: This one is the least developed. I want to interpret some type of data related to my home on the MS gulf coast. Weather, fisheres, birding, etc.

Stay tuned.
